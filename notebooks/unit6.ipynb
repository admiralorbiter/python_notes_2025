    "# Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings (type str) are sequences of characters and are used to represent text data. We’ve been using strings already for things like \"Hello, World!\". In this section, we’ll dive deeper into how to work with strings: concatenation, slicing, and useful string methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Basics of Strings**: You can create a string by enclosing text in single quotes '...' or double quotes \"...\". Both are fine as long as they match. If your string itself contains one type of quote, it’s convenient to use the other to avoid confusion (or escape the quote with a backslash). For example: 'She said \"hi\".' or \"It's raining.\" are valid strings. \n",
    "\n",
    "Strings are **immutable**, meaning once created, they cannot be changed. Any operations that appear to modify a string (like replacing characters) actually create a new string. Keep this in mind: you can’t do my_string[0] = 'H' – that would cause an error. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Concatenation and Repetition**: Use the + operator to concatenate (join) strings, and * to repeat a string a given number of times. For example:"

    "Be careful: only strings can be concatenated with strings. If you try to do \"Age: \" + 16, you’ll get a TypeError because one is str and the other int. You’d need to convert 16 to a string first (str(16)) or use formatted output (more on that later). \n",
    "\n",
    "**String Indexing**: You can access individual characters of a string by index, using square brackets []. Indices start at 0 for the first character. For example:"

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Python supports negative indexing where -1 refers to the last character, -2 the second last, and so on. This is handy to access the end of the string directly. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Slicing Strings**: To extract a substring, use slicing with the syntax s[start:end]. This gives a new string from index start up to but not including end. For example:"

   "cell_type": "code",

   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "You can omit start or end to slice from the beginning or to the end. text[:5] would get \"Hello\" (start from 0 by default), and text[7:] would get \"World!\" (index 7 to the end). Using : with no start or end like text[:] returns the whole string (a copy). Slice syntax allows extracting ranges of characters easily​. Remember that the end index is non-inclusive. If you want the first n characters, use [:n]. If you want from some index to the end, use [index:]. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, you can include a third “step” value: s[start:end:step]. For example, s[::2] returns every second character of the string (skipping one each time). s[::-1] is a neat trick to reverse a string (step -1 means go backwards)."
